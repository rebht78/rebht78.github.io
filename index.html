      <p class="highlight">
        Mission-driven Full Stack Developer with a passion for Back-end, Databases, and teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. 
        Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns — from working with lawyers, 
        to team member of the year at a IT Education Insitute, to Group Leader, 
        to Assistant Manager at a Finance Company.
        I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, 
        my unequivocal love for making things, 
        and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. 
        That's why I’m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.
